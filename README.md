## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I used the MechaCar_mpg database to build a linear regression who can help me predict the MPG of a car based on some of its characteristics. 
I will address the following questions in my analysis : 

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
